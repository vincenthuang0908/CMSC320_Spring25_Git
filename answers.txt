Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It has version control so you have a history of different versions of your code. 

Also, you can use it to collaborate with others where different people can push code onto a repository on GitHub.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Finance, for instance you could analyze stock market data using data science to make predictive models 
to predict what direction the market is going to go. 


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging creates a new merge commit with two branches, and the new merge commit is essentially a 
version that contains the changes from both branches and also retains the histories of the two branches separately.
On the other hand, rebasing also allows you to combine the changes from two different branches but it doesn't retain
the histories of the two branches separately and instead rewrites the history by placing the history from the 
source branch onto the target branch.


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Learning more about different applications of data science and the programming languages and tools 
associated with it. And getting an A in the class of course.
